# Breast Ultrasound Image Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for the classification of breast ultrasound images into three categories: **benign**, **malignant**, and **normal**. Utilizing a pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network model, the system is designed to assist radiologists in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer with high accuracy and consistency.

The project was developed as part of the coursework at **Dayananda Sagar University**, Department of Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML), and is based on a comprehensive methodology that includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation.
